# Custom Basic Navigation Bar in Flutter

This Dart code defines a custom navigation bar widget for use in a Flutter app. It extends the `StatefulWidget` class and overrides the `_MyCustomNavigationBarState` class to define the state of the widget. The `_selectedIndex` variable tracks which navigation item is currently selected, and the `_onItemTapped` method updates this value when a navigation item is tapped. The build method defines the UI for the widget, including a row of navigation items and some styling. The `_buildNavigationItem` method defines the UI for an individual navigation item, including an icon and some styling.
